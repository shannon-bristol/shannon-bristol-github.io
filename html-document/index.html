<p>In the early days of web design, beginning in 1995, pixels were not standardized between <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized, period; and when we got a <strong> standardized layout language</strong> for the web, every browser supported it differently <em>for years</em>.</p>

<p>Later, when standards were better supported in browsers, some of us pretended that “everybody” had a <code>600 x 400</code> monitor (and then an <code>800 x 600</code>, and then <code>1024 x 768</code>), but these too were consensual hallucinations. And even in those rose-colored fixed-width days, there was always a client or a QA tester whose user preference settings, outdated browser, or wonky operating system blew our carefully constructed fixed-width layouts to hell.</p>
