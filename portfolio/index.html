<p class="name">Shannon Bristol</p>
  
  <p class="statement"><strong>My name is Shannon Bristol and I recently finished my first semester of my junior year. I transferred to Montserrat College of Art after completing two years at Dutchess Community College in New York. I realized my passion for the arts when I began high school and took art classes all four years and decided that I wanted to pursue fine arts. At first I was going to be a painting major but that all changed in my last semester at Dutchess when I took my first ever animation class. I have always loved animated movies and for many years my dream goal has been to work at Walt Disney Animations Studio when I get older and it still has never changed. I have always been mesmerized in the masterpieces that Disney and other huge animation studios have created and I want to be a part of that one day even though I know it will be a challenge to get there. 
This semester has taught me new tools like tweens and how important timing is to creating animations and by gradually getting better at what I have been creating, I have come to love animation even more. I can be a very impatient person but when I animate, I become more patient than I have ever been. This shows me how passionate I am about my major. The animations that I created this semester allowed me to be creative and use my imagination to bring things to life. My final project in Animation Traditional to Digital I was most proud of because I was afraid that a thought in my head would not turn out the way I wanted but I was able to use the skills I have learned and to bring it to life.
Next semester I will be focusing more on my major by taking 2D Character Animation, 3D Modeling and Animation, Storyboarding, Audio and Video Media 1, and Animation and Media Projects 1. I want these classes next semester to teach me new skills and appreciate different elements in animation. During my senior year, I want to be able to take History of Animations because I want to be able to learn about how animation has grown since the beginning of it all. Animating makes me feel like I am capable of so much and that I am more proud of myself when an animation is complete./strong></p>
