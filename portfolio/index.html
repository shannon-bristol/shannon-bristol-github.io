<p class="name">Shannon Bristol</p>
  
  <p class="statement"><strong>My name is Shannon Bristol and I currently finished my first semester in
my junior year. I transferred to Montserrat College of Art after
completing two years at Dutchess Community College in New York. I
realized my talent in the arts when I began high school and took art
classes all four years and decided that I wanted to pursue fine arts. At
first I was going to be a painting major but that all changed in my last
semester at Dutchess when I took my first ever animation class. I have
always loved animated movies and for many years my dream goal has been
to work at Walt Disney Animations Studio when I get older and it still
has never changed. I have always been mesmerized in the masterpieces
that Disney and other huge animation studios have created and I want to
be a part of that one day even though I know it will be a challenge to
get there one day.</p> <p class="statement 2"> This semester has taught me new tools like tweens and
how important timing is into creating animations and by gradually
getting better at what I have been creating, I have come to love
animation even more. I can be a very impatient person but when I
animate, I become more patient than I have ever been. This shows me how
passionate I am about my major. The animations that I created this
semester allowed me to be creative and use my imagination to bring
things to life. My final project in Animation Traditional to Digital I
was most proud of because I was afraid that a thought in my head would
not turn out the way I wanted but I was able to use the skills I have
learned and to bring it to life. Any class that involves animation and
to allow me to grow as an animator will be perfect for me for the rest
of my time at Montserrat.</p> <p class="statement 3">I hope to be able to pursue my goal in getting
to be able to see my name on the big screen one day for Disney. Whenever
I see the credits I just imagine seeing my name under the list of
animators who lent a hand into creating movies that impact my life. I
know that it a huge and quite possibly a very difficult goal to
accomplish but I know if I keep working hard at becoming an animator I
will get there one day. Animating makes me feel like I am capable of so
much and that I am more proud of myself when an animation is complete.</strong></p>
