This article is about Zeldman trying something new and seeing if he can try making something old as new. He claims that designers like to complain and it is how they get things done. He later talks about how Instagram has a limited feature set which seems troublesome for designers who want to create more. He realizes that the lack of features does not stop society and famous people from promoting a platform or just showing their everyday lives. Design seems to be more tedious than it used to be and is way more complex.
